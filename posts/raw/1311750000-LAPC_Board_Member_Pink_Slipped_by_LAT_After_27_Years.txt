<p>One of the Los Angeles Times newsroom veterans who learned today that she was laid off is Jane Engle, an assistant editor in Travel who has written a lot for the Travel section. A former editor on the Foreign desk, she’s been with the Times 27 years. She emailed the newsroom an uplifting exit note. Excerpt:</p>
<p>Thanks to all who have helped me and befriended me during my career. Journalism has become a lousy business. But it is still a great profession. For wordsmiths, photographers, artists, designers and the wizards of the Web, it is among the world’s most honorable pursuits.<!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So to those of you who remain aboard the Los Angeles Times: I wish you the best in these dark times. Please keep ferreting out the truth, heckling the wrong-doers and celebrating the human spirit. I will be cheering you on. To those who, like me, are losing their jobs: Please don’t despair. You are more talented than you may know. To deliver demanding work on a deadline is a rare skill. The universe still needs you. And to Wesla: Honey, I’ll be home for dinner all next week — at last!</p>
<p>Engle says in the note that if anyone wants to take her place on the board of the Los Angeles Press Club, they should contact president Will Lewis.</p>
