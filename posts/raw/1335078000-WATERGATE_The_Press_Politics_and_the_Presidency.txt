<p>The Watergate break-in, White House cover-up, Deep Throat’s leaks to Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the two cub reporters at The Washington Post who broke the story… it’s the stuff of legend and arguably marked a sea-change in investigative journalism. <strong>John Dean</strong>, White House counsel to President Nixon, was there through it all, and is here to tell us why forty years ago this political scandal changed the way we cover politics and the presidency forever. He joins KPCC’s <strong>Frank Stoltze</strong> and veteran newsman <strong>Richard Reeves</strong> on Wednesday, May 16 at KPCC’s Crawford Family Forum. Stoltze is two-time winner of the LA Press Club’s Radio Journalist of the Year.<!--more--></p>
