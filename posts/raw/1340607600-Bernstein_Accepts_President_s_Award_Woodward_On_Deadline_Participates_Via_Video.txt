<div>At the June 24 LA Press Club Journalism Awards at the Biltmore, nearly 500 journalists and media executives heard <strong>Carl Bernstein</strong> address the importance of Watergate and the extensive criminal activity encouraged and authorized by President Nixon, as revealed by the hundreds of White House tapes that Nixon had failed to suppress.</div>
<p><strong>Bob Woodward</strong> watched and participated  through a Skype video hookup that allowed the audience to watch and hear him while he watched the award ceremony back east. Woodward couldn’t make the trip because he was on deadline for his next book that’s about Obama.<span id="more-2654"></span></p>
<p>Bernstein talked about how Nixon had wanted to get at Daniel Ellsberg who had leaked the Pentagon Papers to the NY Times and the Washington Post. Nixon referred to Ellsberg as one of those “arrogant Jews.”   But as Bernstein found out by talking to Ellsberg’s granddaughter who was seated at his table, Ellsberg was not Jewish. He was a Christian Scientist. “My Watergate reporting continues,” he quipped.</p>
<div>Bernstein and Woodward were presented the President’s Award by <strong>Martin Sheen</strong> who played President Bartlet on TV for seven years. He was assisted by actress <strong>Pauley Paulette.</strong>
