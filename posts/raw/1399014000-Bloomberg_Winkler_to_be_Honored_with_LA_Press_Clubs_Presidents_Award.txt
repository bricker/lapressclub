<p>Winkler continues to be the Editor in Chief of Bloomberg News, part of Bloomberg L.P., the company founded by Michael R. Bloomberg in 1981.</p>

<p>Bloomberg News is the backbone of the company’s media properties, including Bloomberg Businessweek, Bloomberg TV, Bloomberg Radio, Bloomberg Markets magazine and the recently-launched luxury lifestyle magazine Pursuits.</p>
<p>“Building a news organization of this magnitude is nothing less than remarkable in a time when other organizations are being decimated,” said LA Press Club President Robert Kovacik of NBC LA. “The President’s Award goes to two individuals who have had an impressive impact on media. No one deserves this award more than Michael Bloomberg and Matthew Winkler.”</p>

<p>The Daniel Pearl Award for Courage and Integrity in Journalism and The Quinn Award for Lifetime Achievement as well as the LAPC Public Service Award will also be bestowed that evening. I addition, some of Southern California’s most notable reporters, editors, anchors, and bloggers will also claim their winning plaques for best work of 2013.</p>
