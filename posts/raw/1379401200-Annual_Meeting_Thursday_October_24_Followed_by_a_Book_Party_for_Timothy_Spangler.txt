<p>About the Book:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 5px 20px;" title="One Step Ahead by Timothy Spangler" src="https://evbdn.eventbrite.com/s3-s3/eventlogos/417426/onestepaheadtimothyspangler.jpg" alt="One Step Ahead by Timothy Spangler" width="175" height="261"></p>
<p>ONE STEP AHEAD<br>
As the recession stutters onwards systemic and structural causes for the financial crash continue to dominate international news and debate. Never has there been such an appetite and desire to understand the financial institutions that govern us. But despite public interest, alternative investment vehicles such as private equity and hedge funds remain elusive. Both have always had a unique position in the market, designed as they are to function outside of the rules that govern other financial organizations. But what is it that they do and – significantly – how is it that they have prospered since the 2008 meltdown despite the introduction of new regulatory regimes?</p>
<p>In this accessible and timely study, award-winning writer Timothy Spangler explores how the structures of alternative investment funds enable them to adapt and react to global financial conditions. From small start-ups to the titans of the industry, One Step Ahead is the essential guide to understanding how private equity and hedge funds operate, drive economic growth, and have become essential vehicles for investment for both public and private sectors the world over.</p>

<p>Reviews:</p>
<p>“A brief, readable explanation of how private equity and hedge funds operate and what purpose they serve in the economy… This is a book for people looking for deep understanding and careful analysis, rather than empty sloganeering — and yet it will be immediately accessible to the average reader, which is a remarkable accomplishment.”<br>
Robert VerBruggen, National Review</p>
<p>“Finally a book that sheds a knowledgeable light on the private equity and hedge fund worlds. Long demonized by the media, Spangler has humanized these often secretive industry sectors all the while revealing just how essential they are.”<br>
John Tamny, Forbes Opinions and <a href="http://realclearmarkets.com/">RealClearMarkets.com</a></p>
<p>“Spangler, who understands the nuts and bolts of hedge funds and private equity in the US and European contexts, gives the general public knowledge, which is power, to grasp their role in our economic future.”<br>
Noreen Clancy, RAND Corporation</p>
<p>“Like a series of exceptional New Yorker articles, ONE STEP AHEAD provides a detailed and engaging insider’s view of the seemingly-secret world of alternatives from every perspective”<br>
Karyn Polak, PNC Financial Services</p>
