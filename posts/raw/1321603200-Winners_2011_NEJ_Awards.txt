<p><strong>A – ENTERTAINMENT JOURNALIST OF THE YEAR, ALL PLATFORMS</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tie: Tara Wallis-Finestone, NBC-LA</strong></p>
<p><strong>        Dylan Howard, RadarOnline.com</strong></p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>As a Senior Producer for NBC4, Tara Wallis-Finestone organizes and writes unique and compelling stories for NBC4 in a fast-moving and highly visual manner. She is a gifted story-teller who writes for the eye. She also writes enterprising stories for NBCLA’s website.</em></p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments: </strong><em>In the world of celebrity and entertainment news, even mainstream media couldn’t ignore exclusive stories broken under Dylan Howard’s tenure as senior executive editor of RadarOnline.</em></p>
<p><em>From the hate-filled rants of Mel Gibson, exclusive interviews with Charlie Sheen during his “meltdown,” to the naming of the mother of Schwarzenegger’s “love child,” Howard has become the go-to guy for authoritative show biz news and analysis on cable and over-the air television.</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Ronald Grover, Bloomberg News</p>
<p><strong> <span id="more-1952"></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>B1 – NEWS, PRINT</strong></p>
<p>Scott Gold, Los Angeles Times, “For Vegas, Luck be a Lady”</p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>“Amazingly informative—not only of Dion the performer—but of Dion as an economic force of nature.   And in terms of the corporate health of Las Vegas, perhaps even an emissary from the Heavens.”</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Richard Verrier, Los Angeles Times, “Movie fund in Talks to Save Nursing Home”</p>
<p>HM  Barbara Gasser, Kleine Zeitung, “Kerstin Lechner: Life is not Sticky and Sweet”</p>

<p>Leslie Bruce, The Hollywood Reporter, “The Split Personality of Chelsea Handler”</p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>Leslie Bruce deftly guides the reader through two sides of this talented and sharp-tongued comic—Handler as a writer, a sitcom performer and late night TV host; and Handler as a business woman looking to the future. And she engages the reader equally as she interweaves both stories. Clearly the winner in a heavily contested category.</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Maggie Murphy, Dotson Rader, PARADE Magazine, “Michael Douglas”</p>
<p>HM: Ronald Grover, Tom Lowry and Michael White, Bloomberg Businessweek, “King of the World (Again)”</p>

<p><strong>Judge’s comments<em>:</em></strong><em> </em><em>A thorough, original, well-thought-out and well-written response to the question people didn’t even know they wanted to ask (but recently did):<br>
Who are the Kardashians, anyway – where did they come from and just how big have they strangely become?</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Dawn Chmielewski, Ben Fritz, John Horn, David Pierson and Richard Verrier, Los Angeles Times, “China series”</p>

<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Lisa Wolf, Antelope Valley Press, “Critters of the Cinema”</p>
<p>HM: Karina Longworth, LA Weekly, “Wanda Restoration”</p>

<p>James Rainey, Los Angeles Times “What ails local TV news?”<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>James Rainey is always well worth reading and learning from. He takes his observation post on the media seriously. Here, in suitable tones of outrage is original reporting mixed with commentary on a fraudulent practice that few had recognized.</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Gendy Alimurung, LA Weekly “Gendy Alimurung”</p>
<p>HM: Patrick Goldstein, Los Angeles Times “The Big Picture”</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>B1 – TV NEWS</strong></p>
<p>George Pennacchio, Cheryl Diano, KABC-TV, “Goodbye, Columbo”</p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>Pennacchio weaves in years of past interview with Peter Falk in creating a riveting obituary and tribute to one of TV’s best-loved actors, Peter Falk. This well-crafted piece shows the value of beat reporting, of tapping long-forgotten video and notes to add depth and appeal to a subject. The result shows the arc of Falk’s life, from the early days of film roles in B-pictures to the last days when he was fighting dementia.</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Robert Kovacik, Jeffrey Scharping, KNBC-TV, “Hef Saves the Hollywood Sign”</p>

<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>O’Sullivan does a beautiful job telling the story of group of famous jazz old timers coming together for a recording session like it was done in the old days. The piece is well paced with just the right amount of interview mixed in with a variety of good shots. </em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Carol Massar, et al, Bloomberg TV, “Wall Street: Hollywood Returns”</p>
<p>HM: Manny delaRosa, Matt Parise, KMIR6/NBC, ”Palm springs — playground of the stars”</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>B3 – CRITIC, TV</strong></p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>B4 – DOCUMENTARY, TV</strong></p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>C1 – RADIO NEWS </strong></p>
<p>Sanden Totten, KPCC, “China Hollywood”</p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>This richly-packed report on a $30 million, first-time-ever investment by China into a big Hollywood feature film — an epic love story set in ancient China — has a casual, airy feel that makes for good listening. But it delves into big ideas about how China has not yet perfected the art of the widely appealing blockbuster, so it’s partnering with Hollywood — all with an eye to boosting its influence in the realm of “cultural capital” and eventually assuring that the Western media isn’t the only game in film.</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>:  Carole Zimmer, Bloomberg News, “New Economics of Hollywood”</p>
<p>HM: Alex Cohen, KPCC, “Porn Industry”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>C2 – RADIO PERSONALITY PROFILE </strong></p>
<p>Larry Mantle, Airtalk with Larry Mantle, KPCC, “Dick Van Dyke”</p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>Dick Van Dyke sure doesn’t sound 84 in this sparkling chat that Larry Mantle, who turns this interview into a laughter-filled talk between friends. The conversation turns Van Dyke’s dozens of TV and movie hits to his lifelong collaborators Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie. Van Dyke is jovial and fresh, bragging about his new band, with whom he is having a “romp.” Funny, heartwarming stuff. </em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Adolfo Guzman-Lopez, KPCC, “East LA Musician”</p>
<p>HM: Alex Cohen, KPCC, “Gay Guru”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>C3 – RADIO FEATURE </strong></p>
<p>Brian Lauritzen and Gail Eichenthal, Classical KUSC, “LA Phil in Europe”</p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>A vibrant tale that reports on Dudamel &amp; Co. as Dudamel explores ideas with, and trains, young orchestra students in London. The story is interspersed with fantastic bits of symphonic sound, Dudamel’s high-charged patter, and music students who love the symphony practicing and chuckling at themselves — and at Dudamel. As Lauritzen says “it was intense.”</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: John DeSando and Kristin Dreyer Kramer, WCBE, “It’s Movie Time’s 2010 Year in Review”</p>
<p>HM: Carole Zimmer, Mark Mills, Al Mayers, WBBR Bloomberg Radio, “Spiderman Takes a Dive”</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>C4 – RADIO CRITIC</strong></p>
<p>Kenneth Turan and Gail Eichenthal, Classical KUSC, “Kenneth Turan’s Art Alive Film Reports”</p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments: </strong><em>Turan and Eichenthal make a smooth team, with Turan sharing his pearls of wisdom and asides about his favorite and least-favorite moments in the latest movies as Eichenthal asks him pithy questions. Turan’s quirky voice is by no means a natural for radio, but he knows so much — and shares so much in such a short bit of time — that it really doesn’t matter. Engaging and worthwhile.</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: John DeSando and Kristin Dreyer Kramer, WCBE (Columbus), “Nights and Weekends”</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>D1 – ONLINE NEWS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>Nikki Finke raises the bar on 24/7 Internet reporting of showbiz… tirelessly filing multiple real-time updates of behind-the-scenes details with knowledgeable analysis on the Conan O’Brien/Jay Leno Tonight Show affair.</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>:  Jen Heger &amp; The RadarOnline.com Team, radaronline.com, “Lindsey Lohan’s Legal Troubles”</p>
<p>HM: Pete Hammond, Deadline Hollywood, “Melissa Leo Goes Rogue with Her Own Personal Campaign Ads”</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>D2 – ONLINE FEATURE</strong></p>
<p>David Margolick, Vanity Fair Magazine, “No Comfort for Old Men”</p>
<p><strong>Judge’s comments:</strong> <em>An insightful, beautifully written account of the grassroots battle to save the Motion Picture Home, the beloved hospital and long-term care facility for industry elders run by the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund.</em></p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Keith Plocek, Josh “Curious Josh” Reiss, Lina Lecaro, Wendy Gilmartin, Drew Tewksbury, Jena Ardell. LA Weekly.  “Coachella” series.</p>

<p>Maureen Ryan, AOL TV, The Huffington Post Media Group. “Stay Tuned With Maureen Ryan.”</p>
