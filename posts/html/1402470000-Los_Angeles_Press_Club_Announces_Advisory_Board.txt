Los Angeles Press Club Announces Advisory Board
-----------------------------------------------

<div>
<div>HOLLYWOOD June 11, 2014: The Los Angeles Press Club is pleased to announce the formation of an Advisory Board of prominent individuals from business, government and media. These distinguished leaders in their respective fields will lend their expertise and time to the Clubs continuous effort to support, promote and defend quality journalism in Southern California.</div>

<p>The LA Press Club does an excellent job of connecting members with each other and sponsoring public events, so it made perfect sense to enhance our program with an Advisory Board of non-journalists, said Press Club president Robert Kovacik of NBC4. I am thrilled that so many respected men and women with such a wide range of expertise and experience have agreed to share their wisdom with us. We are fortunate to have these new partners to help us in pursuit of our mission and we deeply appreciate their willingness to participate.</p>

<div>
<p>The Advisory Board will be formally introduced on June 29th at the 2014 Southern California Journalism Awards gala at the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.</p>

Finally, the Los Angeles Press Club provides a place for journalists to gather, network, and learn from one another, especially through the sponsorship of events. The LA Press Club is the only organization in Southern California that speaks for all journalistsnewspapers, magazines, radio, television, and the Internet.</p>
