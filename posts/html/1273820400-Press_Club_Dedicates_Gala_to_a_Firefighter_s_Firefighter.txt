<p><strong>Editor, <em>The Los Angeles Firefighter</em></strong></p>
<p>Jim Perry was a staunch supporter of the Los Angeles Press Club for nearly 40 years and his publications won many LAPC awards over the decades.</p>
<p>But he was better known by his fellow firemen as a firefighters firefighter. He was a founding father of Local 112, United Firefighters of Los Angeles City at a time when union activity was discouraged by the Department.</p>
<p>Jims editorials for the Los Angeles Firefighter regularly tackled hot-button issues without mincing words. Sarah Kovitchs obituary for the newspaper credited Perry with rousing readers into political action.</p>
<p>In 1953, President Kennedy awarded him the National Red Cross Life Saving Award for the LAFDs first successful CPR.</p>
