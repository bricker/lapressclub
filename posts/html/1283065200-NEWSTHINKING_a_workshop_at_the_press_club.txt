On Sept. 9 at 6 p.m.</p>

The seminar calls upon participants to share their writing valueshabits that Bob says click into place and determine what the inner truth of your story is, and whether youre taking the greatest advantage of your facts when you begin to type. These values, Baker says, are what  we admire most about the best writers: how they engage us, define the  story, and develop a musical-like rhythm determining whether youre an  interesting writer or not.  Participants  will test themselves by exchanging writing values supplemented by  Bobs descriptions of some of the best work he edited at The Times. Coach Wooden made his game simple by breaking excellence into a dozen or so sayings, such as Dont confuse activity for achievement and failing to prepare is preparing to fail.  Our  best writers, Bob says, similarly simplify our craft by beating  themselves into submission, inventing personal internal structural rules  that require them to demand of themselves: Have I truly  assembled my most compelling material? Have I composed the story from  the readers point of view? Have I told the emotional and factual truth? The audience will construct its own pyramid of success.  Come with your experiences, complaints and frustrations (no editor-bashing, please) and watch them disappear.  Bob recently re-published his book on mental organization for journalists: <strong>BOB BAKERS NEWSTHINKING: THE SECRET OF MAKING YOUR FACTS FALL INTO PLACE, </strong>available for $19.95 at <a title="http://www.newsthinking.com/" href="http://www.newsthinking.com/" target="_blank">www.newsthinking.com</a> Have a topic youre interested in for the seminar?
