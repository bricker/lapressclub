She is also a bit of a celebrity for being the first Muslim woman comedian in Norwaya title not without its dangers. Now shes coming to Los Angeles to share her shocking and gut-wrenching stories in her one-woman show, <em>The Homeland Insecurity Show</em>. Rehman draws the audience in with off-beat humor, captivates with honesty and floors us with emotion. Rehman is known for other reasons.. Shes a Mullah lifter! To summarize a comical story, she was at a nightclub in Oslo at <strong>Mullah Krekar</strong>s book signing when she abruptly approached the Mullah and picked him upboth proving her strength and her willingness to commit a religious taboo.. According to the <em>New York Times</em>, Krekar is not be trifled with as <strong>founder of Iraqs Ansar al-Islam terrorist group.</strong> Rehmans stunt brought her international attention. It also inspired the Mullahs defenders to shoot 18 bullets through her familys restaurants window. It makes one consider the old adage, Dying is easy, comedy is hard.</p>
