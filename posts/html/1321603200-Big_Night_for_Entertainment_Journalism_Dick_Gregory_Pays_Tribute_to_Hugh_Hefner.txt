<p>Hefner shared his special evening with his son Cooper and girlfriend Anna Sophia Berglund.In a subsequent post on his Twitter.com page, the veteran publisher wrote, The LA Press Clubs Lifetime Achievement dinner proved to be a really special, quite emotional evening for me. The [award] had even more meaning because family &amp; friends were there to share the night.</p>
<p>Dick Gregorys personal tribute was the real highlight of the evening for me. He flew across the country to be here.</p>
<p>The awards gala was held at the Biltmore Bowl. More than 200 attended the dinner, including Laker owner Dr. Jerry Buss and Berry Gordy who founded Motown records.</p>
