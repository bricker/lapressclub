Winners of 52nd Annual SoCal Journalism Awards  Announced
-----------------------------------------------

<div>
<p><strong>A. JOURNALISTS OF THE YEAR</strong></p>
<p><strong>A $1,000 CASH PRIZE: BEST IN SHOW:</strong></p>
<p>Greg Katz, Los Angeles Daily Journal</p>

<p><strong>A1. </strong><strong>PRINT (Over 50,000 circulation)</strong></p>
<p>Alana Semuels, Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>Judges comments: In a year in which no story mattered more than the pain caused by the economic downturn, Semuels nonetheless found fresh and engaging ways to bring a heavily covered story to life. Whether profiling a dying lumber town or a booming community of pot farmers, Semuels brought the economy to life in human terms and took a story often reduced to lifeless statistics and made it viscerally real. Her story about the web of connection linking a handful of the recessions victims was masterful storytelling. And listen to this lede from the aforementioned pot-growing story: Education has long been preached as a way to keep kids away from drugs. Its the walk to school that has Superintendent Tom Barnett worried.</p>
<p>2nd: Christine Pelisek, LA Weekly</p>
<p>HM: Patrick Range McDonald, LA Weekly</p>
<p><strong>A2. </strong><strong>PRINT (Under 50,000 circulation)</strong></p>

<p>Molly Peterson, KPCC</p>
<p>Judges comments: This was a challenging and rewarding category to judge.

<p>Ryan almost deserves to be named Entertainment Journalist of the Year</p>
<p>solely for the 73-word sweep of the lede in King of Pop is dead at</p>
<p>50. Her grasp of, and ability to convey the significance of, Michael</p>

<p>year of his death. But Ryan doesnt just earn the distinction with her</p>
<p>Jackson coverage.</p>

<p>HM: John Horn, Los Angeles Times</p>

<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Darrick Rainey, LA Weekly</p>

<p><strong>A9. ONLINE</strong><strong> JOURNALIST</strong></p>
<p>Bill Boyarsky, Truthdig</p>
<p>Judges Comments: In a highly competitive field, Boyarsky set himself apart by taking on health care reform  arguably one of last years biggest stories  in a personable, yet informative approach. Boyarsky had a very controlled balance in his writing that really told the reader what was happening in a rather complex story and why it mattered.</p>
<p>2nd: Robert Scheer, Truthdig</p>
<p>HM: Eric Longabardi, ABCNews.com</p>
<p><strong>B. DAILY/WEEKLY NEWSPAPERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Over 50,000 circulation  including news bureaus and correspondents</strong></p>

<p><strong>B1. </strong><strong>HARD NEWS </strong></p>
<p>Tracy Manzer, Kelly Puente, Long Beach Press-Telegram, 3 die in rampage</p>
<p>Judges comments<strong>: </strong>Good retelling of the incident from officials sources. Good decision to take the next step of interviewing witnesses, with Collins delivering a dramatic quote. The reader can appreciate the attempt, on deadline, to discern the shooters motive. The timeline helps add depth to the reporting. Fine work.</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Greg Mellen, Long Beach Press-Telegram, Shooting stuns city</p>

<p><strong>B2. </strong><strong>NEWS FEATURE </strong></p>
<p>Thomas Curwen, Los Angeles Times,  Anas Story</p>
<p>Judges comments: This is an intricately researched and written story that takes you into Ana Rodartes travails on so many levels that you are left certain that the reader will know more about some aspects of this story than some of the main characters in it. The four-year relationship with the main subject is impressive work, and the bold digression into first person only humanizes the story more. The detailed medical explanations, meanwhile, leave no doubt about what is going on and why. In a category with several excellently written or reported stories, this presents the most artful combination of those two skills.</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Courtney Moreno, LA Weekly,  Help Is on the Way: Tales of an Ambulance Driver</p>
<p>HM: Alana Semuels, Los Angeles Times,  Watching the bad news trickle down</p>

<p><strong>B3. PERSONALITY PROFILE </strong></p>
<p>Vickie Chang, OC Weekly, Skitch in Time</p>
<p>Judges comments: The goal of a personality profile is to get to know someone, and this reporter not only introduces readers to a 57-year-old pioneer surfer/skater, but lets them learn about who he was, which is key to who he is now. Well-written and descriptive, with colorful and honest quotes.</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Esmeralda Bermudez, Los Angeles Times, She Finally Has a Home: Harvard</p>
<p>HM: Christine Pelisek, LA Weekly, Grim Sleepers Sole Survivor</p>

<p><strong>B5. </strong><strong>INVESTIGATIVE/SERIES</strong></p>
<p>Charles Ornstein and Tracy Weber, Pro-Publica and the Los Angeles Times, When Caregivers Harm</p>
<p>Judges comments: This is what investigative journalism is all about: Combing through thousands of pages of documents to discover a broken system in which nurses who harm their patients are allowed to do it over and over again. Truly outstanding journalism.</p>
<p>2nd: Jason Song, Jason Felch, and Jessica Garrison, Los Angeles Times, Failure Gets a Pass</p>
<p>HM: Scott Gold, Los Angeles Times, Promise and Peril in South L.A.</p>

<p><strong>B6. </strong><strong>BUSINESS</strong></p>
<p>Gendy Alimurung, <em>LA </em>Weekly, Man on Man: The New Gay Romance  written by and for straight women</p>

<p>HM: Amy Alkon, Creators Syndicate</p>
<p><strong>B8. </strong><strong>COLUMNIST </strong></p>
<p>Gustavo Arellano, OC Weekly, Ask a Mexican</p>
<p>Judges comments: With equal measures of humor, intelligence, common sense and bravery, Arellano addresses some of the most crucial issues facing our country.</p>
<p>He debunks myths making their way unchallenged through the mainstream media; hes also not above giving serious thought to questions that might seem trivial. He lets readers be curious about cultural differences (which is, after all, human nature), and shows that only through open discussion of those differences can we transcend them.</p>
<p>Arellano is single-handedly defending important territory in this nations culture wars.</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: George Skelton, Los Angeles Times, Capitol Journal</p>
<p>HM: Patrick Goldstein, Los Angeles Times, The Big Picture</p>
<p><strong>B9. </strong><strong>ENTERTAINMENT REVIEWS/CRITICISM/COLUMN </strong>1st Place</p>
<p>Mary McNamara, Los Angeles Times, Critics Notebook</p>
<p>Whether shes writing about President Barack Obama or the real</p>
<p>housewives of Orange County, McNamara delivers helpful insights into</p>

<p>to be skeptical of what is presented as the truth  whether its on</p>
<p>television or at church.</p>

<p>Andy Fixmer and Sarab Rabil, Bloomberg News, Plunge may force studios to write down movies</p>
<p>Judges comments: From an investors viewpoint, this story is chilling. Write-downs hurt bottom lines, but DVD losses are alarming. And then to hear, Making a movie just wont be as profitable as it once was, could send investors running for the exits. Excellent, tight writing.</p>
<p>HM: Vickie Chang, OC Weekly, Pay for Play</p>
<p><strong>B11. </strong><strong>SPORTS </strong></p>
<p>Jon Gold, Los Angeles Daily News, Mission:Possible,</p>
<p>Judges comments: Mr. Gold gets inside Midnight Mission basketball and the men whose darkened lives have been rekindled by hope. Rarely do we see this kind of writing and reporting in the daily sports pages.</p>

<p>Judges comments:This is a textbook example of good reporting.<br>

<p>Judges comments: Her gripping account of life for two Catholic priests in China is superb. She calmly explains the constant political upheaval in China, the awful effects of those changes on Winance and Zhou  and their unflinching faith  and finally, how they emerged later with new lives.

<p>Judges Comments: The death of Michael Jackson was a story no newspaper or magazine on the planet could, or did, ignore. What Siklos did was dive deep below the surface of the Michael Jackson story to unravel the intricacies of Jacksons finances and his ill-fated final concert tour.</p>

<p>Molly Peterson, Southern California Public Radio, Pumps Under Pressure: A story of risk and reliability after Katrina</p>
<p>Judges Comments: An incredibly thorough and eye-opening piece with numerous links and other online components such as timelines, testing records and reports, and reader feedback. It left me feeling discouraged about government but inspired by the power of journalism to shed light on such issues. In an age when minute-by-minute celebrity gossip seems to dominate the Internet, its heartening to see some members of the media are taking their roles as members of the fourth branch of government.</p>

<p><strong>H2. MULTI MEDIA PACKAGE</strong></p>
<p>Staff, Los Angeles Times, Mexico Under Siege: The drug war at our doorstep</p>
<p>Judges comments: This package is eye-catching and intriguing the second the page opens. The climbing number of drug-related deaths and other red, large type numbers give perspective and set story tone right away. Rotating multimedia promo box  with video, recent stories and featured comment/quote  give reader choices. The best feature is the interactive map showing drugwar hotspots, but also quick info of drug-war players, who they are and why they matter. The multimedia gallery also quickly shows the seriousness of this package, and lets the reader dive deeper into the subject matter at thei own pace. This package is compelling, thought provoking and easy to navigate, making it both informational and easy to understand.</p>

<p>Judges Comments: In a diverse field, what stood out the most about the first-place entry was the thoughtfulness of it. The writer went beyond the basic subject matter  Tiger Woods personal problems  and delved more deeply into the bigger picture of the medias role and especially societys role as a whole in this story. The reader was given plenty to think about as well reasons why they should be thinking about it.</p>

<p><strong>I. INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISM</strong></p>

<p><strong>I1. HARD NEWS </strong></p>
<p>Tom Walters, Adam Blair, CTV-News, Wild Fire</p>
<p>Judges comments: Going beyond the advantage provided by the dramatic visual presentation, this report comes from ground zero with interviews from firefighters putting their lives on the line. Excellent work.</p>

<p>Barbara Gasser, M, My Entertainment, Bruno</p>
<p>Judges comments: Bruno comes across as hilarious and irreverent  a tornado that one should flee, but at the same time must be observed. The way the story is handled, with the reporter getting out of the way and letting the subject talk, is a plus. Even so, there is no sense of location or the gesticulations and expressions that help bring a subject to life.</p>

<p><strong>J. YOUTH AND STUDENT MEDIA</strong></p>
<p><strong>J1. BEST COLLEGE NEWSPAPER</strong></p>
<p>LA Collegian: Clean and colorful layout jammed with a nice mix of interesting and well-written stories that ranged from typical upbeat college stories like Math Teams Secret Recipe for Success and City College Dancer Pursues Passion, to newsier items like Murder Trial Set to Begin for Former LACC Instructor and a more in-depth piece on how H1N1 spreads paranoia. Two presentation standouts were features about trips taken by students, one in the Crimea and another to West Africa. In both of these features, excellent layout and writing, and wonderful handling of what could have been fairly routine student travel stories.</p>
<p>Room for improvement: This paper would greatly improve with a stronger emphasis on hard news, and far less of the easy-to-do opinion columns that are frontloaded into the newspaper.</p>
<p>Second Place:</p>
<p>CSUN Daily Sundial: The Sundial is clearly emphasizing hard news, and several stories stand out: The return to the US of Esha Momeni, a CSUN student imprisoned in Iran, and the followup story about her graduate project focused on her imprisonment; a detailed look back at the Metrolink tragedy; and a piece about two top basketball players facing felony stealing charges for pulling an inside job to steal high tech equipment from a Best Buy.</p>
<p>Room for improvement: The filler stories from Associated Press greatly take away from the overall quality of what is an excellent student paper, suggesting that the Sundial and its faculty advisors badly need to attract more journalism students to create original content for the print version of the Sundial.</p>

<p><strong>J2. BEST HIGH SCHOOL NEWSPAPER</strong></p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p><strong>J3. BEST MAGAZINE</strong></p>
<p>Collegian Times 80th Anniversary:</p>
<p>A crisp and readable special issue filled with interesting personality profiles and excellent photos. One standout story was Focused on the Future, about a gifted photographer whose previous life was a personal train wreck. Another excellent piece was a detailed take-down of the disastrous LACC baseball program under disorganized and divisive new head coach George Hinshaw.</p>
<p><strong>J4. BEST NEWS WEBSITE OR BLOG</strong></p>
<p>Winner:</p>
<p>Annenberg TV News (Website Manager Derek Staahl) shows what happens when you mix talented students with plenty of well-funded, high-end technology. This site offers a lot of excellent coverage and reports, heavy on sports and entertainment, but not afraid to dip its toe into City Council controversies and other hard news.</p>
<p>Second place:</p>
<p>Daily Sundial (Jacky Guerrero):</p>
<p>This site is a solid mix of news and blog posts, well presented and easy to access, with a strong multimedia component and a good mix of news and lifestyle coverage.</p>
<p>Honorable Mention:</p>
<p>Annenberg TV News (Website Manager Jackie Tsai) offers a multi-media complement of photos, videos and text within the larger site. Its filled with interesting real-life stories of students, trend pieces and newsier stories with a social message.</p>

<p><strong>J5. BEST NEWS BROADCAST OR PUBLIC AFFAIRS RADIO OR WEB RADIO</strong></p>
<p>Annenberg Radio News, airdate March 12, 2009</p>
<p>Smart, fast-moving, and easy to understand. Excellent editing and sound. One standout interview is with an employee of the MTA where mechanics working on a fleet of hundreds of buses are replacing old engines with fuel-efficient ones. The worker is explaining that says the federal stimulus money will be important to the plan to make the fleet cleaner. Another good report is on farmers markets, highlighted by a quirky interview with a man who loves farmers markets because he wants to taste the real taste of food.</p>
<p>Room for Improvement:</p>
<p>Despite the need for brevity in radio, these reports would be improved by a quick explanation of the other side  even a very brief nod is better than nothing. Not everyone agrees that costly new parks are a good expenditure during a recession, nor do economists agree whether stimulus money should go to existing projects such as those described at the MTA. Similarly, quoting partisan spokesmen who are being paid to attack other politicians is fair game, but the reporter should make clear who the speaker is. Adding as little as five seconds to each report will create a more balanced and intelligent program.</p>
<p><strong>J6. BEST NEWS BROADCAST OR PUBLIC AFFAIRS TV OR CABLE</strong></p>
<p>Annenberg TV News, March 30, 2009</p>
<p>Excellent package of coverage dominated by the story of the terrible hit-and-run death of Adrianna Bachan outside USC. Several strengths stand out, including the reporting of Mat Mendez, who gathered riveting and horribly sad coverage of the sobbing mother shaking photos of her dead daughter at passersby and journalists. The producers followed this dramatic segment with an excellent feature about the favorite memories of the dead students friends, and wrapped up the package with several additional reports involving questions of whether USC officials had done enough, whether pedestrian safety is sufficient in the area, and the psychology behind hit-and-run crimes. Excellent editing and sound.</p>
<p>Room for Improvement: While it is nice to see university students training for future careers as news anchors, it is disconcerting to see young people exactly copying the formulaic segues, vocal intonations and slightly disinterested air practiced by adult anchors. TV news anchoring is often the butt of jokes. It would be nice to see students stretch their wings and try something new rather than striving so hard to closely emulate the adults at channels 2 through 11. There wont be many chances to do it differently once they land those jobs at the nightly news.</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: Annenberg TV News, December 2, 2009</p>
<p>Excellent reporting on the Tiger Woods fiasco, and a warm and personable presentation by the anchors.</p>
<p><strong>J7. BEST WRITINGPRINT</strong></p>
<p>Winner:</p>
<p>Mars Melnicoff, Los Angeles Collegian, Paper Trail May Lead to Problems for Mens Basketball. http://lapressclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/finalists3.docx</p>
<p>An excellent and hard-hitting investigative story about apparently false statements by LACC basketball players about where they went to high school, which could affect their eligibility to play basketball at LACC. The story includes on-the-record threats made against the student reporter when the reporter contacted LACC basketball coach Mack Cleveland for comment. The hair-raising experience of reporter Melnicoff, who quoted Coach Cleveland as saying, If you want to stay [at LACC] I highly recommend that you drop this story is a reminder that college students are engaged in very real journalism, often with high stakes, in which they must buck the status quo. Bravo to student Melnicoff for refusing to be cowed.</p>
<p>Second Place:</p>
<p>Daniel Oh, Los Angeles Collegian, Ratatouille. Fabulous writing.</p>
<p>Honorable Mention:</p>
<p>Daniel Oh, Los Angeles Collegian, Obama Madness.</p>
