<p>According to Wikipedia,The Biltmore is known for once being a home to the Oscars. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences was founded at a luncheon banquet in the Crystal Ballroom in May 1927, when guests like Louis B. Mayer met to discuss plans for presenting achievement awards. Legend has it that MGM art director Cederic Gibbons, immediately grabbed a Biltmore napkin and sketched the design for the Oscar.. In 1977 Bob Hope hosted the Academys 50th Anniversary banquet in the same room.</p>
