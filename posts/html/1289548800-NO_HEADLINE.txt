<p>Although<em>Variety</em>s<strong><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/Andrew-Stewart-profile.html">Andrew Stewart</a></strong> was a no-show at the Thursday, November 11th Los Angeles Press Club<a href="../uncategorized/transforming-the-trades-covering-media-and-entertainment-in-the-crossplatform-age/" target="_">panel discussion</a> examining the challenging future of entertainment trade reporting, that still left<strong><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/Gregg-Kilday-profile.html">Gregg Kilday</a></strong> of<em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>,<strong><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/Bob-Tourtellotte-profile.html">Bob Tourtellotte</a></strong>from Reuters,<strong><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/Andrew-Hampp-profile.html">Andrew Hampp</a></strong> of<em>Ad Age</em> and The Wraps<strong><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/Josh-Dickey-profile.html">Josh Dickey</a> </strong>(pictured), subbing for a screening-diverted<strong><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/Sharon-Waxman-profile.html">Sharon Waxman</a></strong><!--more-->.During a 90-minute discussion moderated by NPR contributor<strong><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/Anthea-Raymond-profile.html">Anthea Raymond</a></strong>, each panelist made fine observations about the current state of the Hollywood and Madison Ave. trade nation, touching on everything from the broad re-purposing of an<em>Us Weekly</em> story about Beyonce being pregnant (she wasnt) to the Mad Hatter beats of Twitter feeds.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the energetic star of the show was<em>Wrap</em> Deputy Editor Dickey, a former AP entertainment breaking news wizard. He peppered the evening with jokes, crowd participation entreaties and no shortage of intriguing nomenclature.</p>
<p>Theres lots of airbrushed journalism today, Dickey noted in reference to the online practice of making inaccurate things disappear rather than posting proper, print-style corrections. We all know who does it. Another blood sport observation from Dickey was the feeling, per a question from Raymond, that todays online audience for trade reporting is definitely being responded to rather than being created.</p>
<p>Sitting front row, middle last night was attorney<strong><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/Jonathan-Handel-profile.html">Jonathan Handel</a></strong>, a self-described<a href="http://digitalmedialaw.blogspot.com/" target="_">citizen journalist</a> who prefaced his audience question by explaining that he now also covers the beat of entertainment labor law for the<em>Reporter</em>. As such, he was a most conveniently placed sign of these changing trade reporting times.</p>
