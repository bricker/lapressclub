<p>On  April 19, 2010 suspected counterfeiter, drug dealer and weapons maker <strong>Brian  Alexik</strong> evaded police at the door of his ritzy Downtown penthouse  which  overlooked the L.A. branch of the Federal Reserve bank  by sneaking  down a fire escape. On June 3, he was arrested in a rundown apartment  barely a mile from his home. In the following months, he opened up to <em>Los Angeles Downtown News</em> reporter <strong>Ryan Vaillancourt</strong>, who had been the first to cover the story.  The two spoke repeatedly on the phone and, Alexik sent letters, and Vaillancourt visited him in prison.</p>
<p>On Feb. 10, Vaillancourt will discuss the jailhouse mind of a person the LAPD  warned should be considered armed and dangerous. But thats just the  beginning of the story for a man who lived the high life, partied with  Bono and is representing himself in court.</p>
