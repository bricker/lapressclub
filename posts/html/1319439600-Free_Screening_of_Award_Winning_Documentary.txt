Free Screening of Award-Winning Documentary
-----------------------------------------------

<div>
<p><em><strong>A Bitter Taste of Freedom </strong></em>afilm by <strong>Marina Goldovskaya.</strong></p>
<p>It is a documentary about slain Russian reporter <strong>Anna Politkovskaya</strong>. While it is a personal and touching portrayal of Anna Politovskaya as a troubled wife and loving mother, it also shows the lengths that she, as a journalist, would go in the search for truth. She was investigating breach of human rights in Chetznya. This documentary was co-winner of the Montreal Festival.</p>
<p>Variety: <em>Profoundly moving, politically provocative and apt to provoke moral outrage in anyone short of Vladimir Putin. </em>Following the free screening, Ms. Goldovskaya will address the audience in a Q &amp; A.</p>
<p>The <strong>Los Angeles Press Club</strong> posthumously awarded Ms.Politkovskaya the <strong>Daniel Pearl Award for Courage and Integrity in Journalism</strong> in 2007.</p>
