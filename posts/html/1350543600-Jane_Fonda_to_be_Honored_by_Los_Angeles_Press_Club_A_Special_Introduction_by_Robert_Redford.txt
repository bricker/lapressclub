<p>Los Angeles Press Club will honor Jane Fonda with its inaugural <em>Visionary Award</em> at the National Entertainment.<br>
Journalism Awards Gala on Sunday, November 18<sup>th</sup> at the Biltmore Hotel, downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The <em>Visionary Award</em> is being instituted to pay homage to an individual within the Entertainment Industry who uses their high-profile status to make the world a better place and to spread information about issues of freedom and social importance.</p>
<p>Beside her successful careers as a two-time Academy Award winning actress, star of a Broadway smash hit, fitness guru and best-selling author, Ms. Fonda has worked tirelessly, and not always without controversy, for people less fortunate than herself. The Los Angeles Press Club can think of no one who better personifies the <em>Visionary </em>spirit or who is more deserving of being honored than Jane Fonda. Her empathy has shown the world that both celebrity and artistic talent can be used to improve the lives of others, said Diana Ljungaeus, Executive Director of the Press Club.</p>
