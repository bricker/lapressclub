<p>Next year marks a major milestone in American journalism: the 40th anniversary of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernsteins pioneering reporting on the Watergate scandal.</p>
<p>Woodward and Bernsteins series of articles for The Washington Post unraveled the biggest American political scandal to date, culminatingin President Richard Nixons resignation in 1974. Four decades later, the stories still stand as a bellwether of investigative journalism.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, the Los Angeles Press Club will honor Woodward and Bernstein with the 2012 Presidents Award. The Pulitzer-prize winning journalists will accept the award in person at the 54th annual Southern California Journalism Awards.</p>
<p>Because of their fearless reporting, American journalism would never be the same, said LA Press Club President Will Lewis. The Presidents Award goes to individuals who have had an impact on media.I can think of no one who deserves this award more than Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.</p>

<p>The scandal that made Woodward and Bernstein the most famous reporters in America started with a mysterious break-in at the Democratic Party headquarters in Washington, D.C.s Watergate office complex, by five burglars dressed in business suits. Starting from that one bizarre event, Woodward and Bernstein followed a trail of clues that reached ever-higher to eventually expose a wide-ranging conspiracy of political sabotage aimed at undermining the electoral process. The revelations exposed a previously little-seen dark side of American politics and led to the indictments of 40 White House and administration officials. Ultimately, President Richard Nixon resigned on Aug 9, 1974.<a href="http://lapressclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/woodstein-today.jpg"><img title="woodstein today" src="http://lapressclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/woodstein-today-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a></p>
<p>Along the way, Woodward and Bernstein became household names synonymous with investigative journalism. Their work on the storyhas been credited with inspiring generations of journalists, the formation of entire investigative teams at newspapers and increased media scrutiny of the White House. It also helped raise theWashington Post to international stature. Public trust in the federal government has never been the same since. To this day, the media still tacks on the suffix gate when referring to major politicalscandals.</p>
<p>As media critic Ben Bagdikian told the American Journalism Review in 2004, Woodward and Bernstein produced the single most spectacularact of serious journalism [of the 20th] century.</p>
<p>Woodward and Bernsteins work on the stories earned the Washington Post a Pulitzer Prize in 1973. Their collaboration also expanded intotwo best-selling books, All the Presidents Men and The Final Days. The hit 1976 movie version of All the Presidents Men starred Robert Redford as Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, and won several Academy Awards.</p>
<p>The story of Watergate continues to live on. In 2005, the news media was abuzz when Vanity Fair magazine identified Woodwardand Bernsteins famed anonymous source, Deep Throat as former FBI official Mark Felt. More recently, the National Archives in November released transcripts of Nixons grand jury testimony in 1975, making international headlines.</p>
<p>Yet Watergate is not Woodward and Bernsteins only claim to fame. Woodward, who graduated from Yale University in 1965 and started his career at the Montgomery County Maryland) Sentinel, remains at the Washington Post to this day. He has won nearly every majorAmerican journalism award during his career, and has authored or co-authored twelve #1 national bestsellers. His books include Bush atWar, Plan of Attack and Obamas Wars. The television program 60 Minutes has produced segments on seven of Woodwards books, andthree of his books have been turned into movies.</p>
<p>Bernstein, who went to work at age 16 as a copyboy for The Washington Star and joined the Post staff six years later, has written for numerous publications in the years since Watergate. His work has appeared in Vanity Fair (for which he is also a contributing editor), Time, USA Today, The New York Times and The New Republic. He has served as Washington Bureau Chief and correspondent for ABC News, a political analyst for CNN. His books include the biography A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hilary Rodham Clintonand Loyalties, a memoir about his parents during McCarthy-era Washington.</p>
