<p>With Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky termed out, the race to represent Los Angeles Countys 3rd District is wide open for the first time in 20 years. Former state lawmaker Sheila Kuehl and former mayors Bobby Shriver, John Duran and Pamela Ulich are competing to become the elected representative of the 2 million people who live in the San Fernando Valley and the Westside, and along the coast from Malibu to Santa Monica.</p>
<p>What are their ideas for preventing abuses by the Sheriffs Department? How would they reform the troubled foster care system? Can they patch the holes in the social safety net? These and other questions will be answered on March 27, as the Los Angeles Press Club hosts a public debate among the candidates, with Patt Morrison (Los Angeles Times / KPCC) moderating. Questions will come from members of the LA press club, professional journalists working in Los Angeles in every platform.
