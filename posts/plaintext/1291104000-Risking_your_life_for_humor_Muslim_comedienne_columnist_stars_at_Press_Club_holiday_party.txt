Risking your life for humor  Muslim comedienne/columnist stars at Press Club holiday party
-----------------------------------------------

Shabana Rehman will make you laugh in unexpected ways. She is also a bit of a celebrity for being the first Muslim woman comedian in Norway—a title not without its dangers. Now she’s coming to Los Angeles to share her shocking and gut-wrenching stories in her one-woman show, The Homeland Insecurity Show.  Rehman draws the audience in with off-beat humor, captivates with honesty and floors us with emotion. Rehman is known for other reasons.. She’s a Mullah lifter! To summarize a comical story, she was at a nightclub in Oslo at Mullah Krekar‘s book signing when she abruptly approached the Mullah and picked him up—both proving her strength and her willingness to commit a religious taboo.. According to the New York Times, Krekar is not be trifled with as “founder of Iraq’s Ansar al-Islam terrorist group.” Rehman’s stunt brought her international attention. It also inspired the Mullah’s defenders to shoot 18 bullets through her family’s restaurant’s window.  It makes one consider the old adage, “Dying is easy, comedy is hard.”

Rehman, who is also a columnist at the largest newspaper in Norway (Aftenposten), will do a special appearance at Los Angeles Press Club on Thursday, December 9 – talking back to the audience about censorship, freedom of speech, journalism and religion. R.S.V.P.
