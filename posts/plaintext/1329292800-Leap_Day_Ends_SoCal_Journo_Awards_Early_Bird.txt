Leap Day Ends SoCal Journo Awards Early Bird
-----------------------------------------------

Dear Journalist:

You have one extra day—Leap Day Feb. 29—to enter and win a Los Angeles Press Club SoCal Journalism Award and save on every entry with our Early Bird rates. 

We’re looking for the best work of 2011 in print, broadcast and the Internet, including the social networks.

If there were ever a year to become a finalist in the LA Press Club’s SoCal Journalism Awards, 2012 is the year.

You’ll be receiving your winner’s plaque in the presence of that legendary reporting team of Woodward and Bernstein who are being honored on the 40th anniversary of Watergate.

“The line on a reporter’s resume that he or she has received an LA Press Club Award continues to be a mark of distinction,” said LA Press Club President Will Lewis.

The contest has lowered the fee to enter the Journalist of the Year category, added Best College and Best High School Newspaper and expanded the broadcast categories to include online audio and video, including podcasts and streaming.

New this year: Social Media has a category of its own for Best Tweets and Facebook Presence.

You’ll save over 20% on entry fees if you apply before March1 and take advantage of Early Bird fees. Final deadline is March 30.

And good luck!

Diana
