How I Got That Story
-----------------------------------------------

Bono and Alexik

On  April 19, 2010 suspected counterfeiter, drug dealer and weapons maker Brian  Alexik evaded police at the door of his ritzy Downtown penthouse — which  overlooked the L.A. branch of the Federal Reserve bank — by sneaking  down a fire escape. On June 3, he was arrested in a rundown apartment  barely a mile from his home. In the following months, he opened up to Los Angeles Downtown News reporter Ryan Vaillancourt, who had been the first to cover the story.  The two spoke repeatedly on the phone and, Alexik sent letters, and Vaillancourt visited him in prison.

On Feb. 10, Vaillancourt will discuss the jailhouse mind of a person the LAPD  warned should be considered armed and dangerous. But that’s just the  beginning of the story for a man who lived the high life, partied with  Bono and is representing himself in court.
