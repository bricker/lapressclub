“Janice Min’s turning around The Hollywood Reporter is nothing short of remarkable,” said Diana Ljungaeus, executive director for LA PressClub.

“Coming from the venerable Los Angeles Press Club, the Luminary Award is truly the honor of a lifetime,” said Min. “While I’m personally thrilled, I’m also grateful to my staff at The Hollywood Reporter, whose hard work and excellence have made this possible.”

The Career Achievement Award was instituted to honor a distinguished member of the  Entertainment Journalism community. First winner was Joe Morgenstern, film critic for The Wall Street Journal. Playboy’s Hugh M. Hefner was last year’s honoree.
