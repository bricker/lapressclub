Getting Ready for the Big One -- A Reporter's Guide
-----------------------------------------------

In the last several weeks, jarring earthquakes have rattled the region, reminding all of us as residents and journalists of this unavoidable aspect of life in Southern California.

Please join AAJA-LA and the Los Angeles Press Club for “Getting Ready for the Big One: A Reporter’s Guide”  at the LA Press Club.

Robert Kovacik, anchor-reporter at NBC4, will moderate the panel of Los Angeles Times reporters whose groundbreaking stories have helped bring new awareness to earthquake safety and revealed hundreds of at-risk structures in Los Angeles. They’ll be joined by a Red Cross Communications Officer:

The panelists:

— Rong-Gong Lin II, earthquake safety reporter
— Ken Schwencke, digital editor
— Doug Smith, database editor
–Terri Corigliano, Red Cross

Ron, Ken and Doug will talk about the coverage strategies and tools the Times has used in its reporting, including Ken’s “quakebot,” which generates automated blog posts when an earthquake hits.

THURSDAY, May 8th. Doors will open at 7 p.m.; pizza and light refreshments will be provided to first-comers. The panel will begin at 7:30. The event is free for AAJA-LA and L.A. Press Club members, $5 for members of sister journalism and diversity organizations, and $10 for members of the public.
