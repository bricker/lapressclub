Los Angeles Press Club has teamed up with NBC Los Angeles to bring you this important debate live.

With Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky termed out, the race to represent Los Angeles County’s 3rd District is wide open for the first time in 20 years. Former state lawmaker Sheila Kuehl and former mayors Bobby Shriver, John Duran and Pamela Ulich are competing to become the elected representative of the 2 million people who live in the San Fernando Valley and the Westside, and along the coast from Malibu to Santa Monica.

What are their ideas for preventing abuses by the Sheriff’s Department? How would they reform the troubled foster care system? Can they patch the holes in the social safety net?  These and other questions will be answered on March 27, as the Los Angeles Press Club hosts a public debate among the candidates, with Patt Morrison (Los Angeles Times / KPCC) moderating. Questions will come from members of the LA press club, professional journalists working in Los Angeles in every platform.  To submit a question email it to Diana-AT-lapressclub.org and put “Debate Question” in the subject line.

The event is free to all, but an R.S.V.P. is a must. Plenty of free parking behind the building. Refreshments will be served.

Date & Time : March 27,  7pm (doors open at 6pm). The debate starts at 7 pm sharp, so be sure to be seated by then.
Venue: The Los Angeles Press Club, 4773 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90027
