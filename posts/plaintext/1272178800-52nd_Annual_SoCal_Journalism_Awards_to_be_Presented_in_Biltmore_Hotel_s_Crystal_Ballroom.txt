52nd Annual SoCal Journalism Awards to be Presented in Biltmore Hotel's Crystal Ballroom
-----------------------------------------------

Crystal Ballroom, Biltmore Hotel

When CNN’s Anderson Cooper is presented the Los Angeles Press Club’s President’s Award for impact on the media, he will be in the legendary Crystal Ballroom at the Millennium Biltmore, where the Oscars were born.

An expected 400 journalists and their invited guests will gather on the evening of June 27th to find out who among them have won in the 52nd Annual Southern California Journalism Awards competition. 

Dave Bryan, a TV reporter for more than 30 years at KTTV and now at CBS2/KCAL9, will receive the Joseph M. Quinn Award for lifetime achievement.

According to Wikipedia,The Biltmore “is known for once being a home to the Oscars. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences was founded at a luncheon banquet in the Crystal Ballroom in May 1927, when guests like Louis B. Mayer met to discuss plans for presenting achievement awards…. Legend has it that MGM art director Cederic Gibbons, immediately grabbed a Biltmore napkin and sketched the design for the Oscar….. In 1977 Bob Hope hosted the Academy’s 50th Anniversary banquet in the same room.”
