AOL Patch Editorial Director at the Press Club
-----------------------------------------------

Marcia Parker, West Coast editorial director for Patch.com, AOL’s rapidly expanding hyper-local news project now in several California cities, will speak at the Los Angeles Press Club’s annual meeting Thursday, October 14, at 7 p.m. at the club’s headquarters in Hollywood.Whether a Press Club member or not, you’re warmly invited to hear about  Journalism 2.0 — as envisioned by one of the few corporations in America  currently hiring bloggers, writers and editors in California.
Parker, who joined Patch from the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley,  where she served as Assistant Dean for six years, will explain Patch’s  plan to attract readers and advertisers by focusing on community news. A  casual, lively Q and A will follow. R.S.V.P
