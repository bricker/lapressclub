Neil Strauss on "Everybody Loves You When You're Dead"
-----------------------------------------------

For  anyone intrigued by what makes top musicians and celebrities tick, read about and watch video from this event.
Press Club to meet prolific Rolling Stone and New York Times reporter and bestselling author Neil Strauss as he gives us an early glimpse at his provocative new book, “Everybody Loves You When You’re Dead.”

Neil, a denizen of Laurel Canyon, and author of previous New York Times bestsellers “The Game” and “Rules of the Game” and co-author of Motley Crue’s “The Dirt” and Marilyn Manson’s “The Long Hard Road Out of Hell,”  officially launches his book in mid-March. It features 228 of the most  telling moments he documented in the lives of musicians and celebrities,  culled from his lifetime body of more 3,000 articles and reporter’s  notes.
R.S.V.P.


Come and rub elbows with a man who has covered Lady Gaga, Tom Cruise, Russell Brand, Radiohead, Justin Timberlake, Bon Jovi, Nirvana and dozens more bands, artists and top names. As Harper Collins describes it: “He makes Lady Gaga cry, tries to keep Motley Crue out of jail and gets kidnapped by Courtney Love.”
