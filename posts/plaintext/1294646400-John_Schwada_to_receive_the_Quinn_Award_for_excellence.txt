John Schwada to receive the Quinn Award for excellence
-----------------------------------------------

The Joseph M. Quinn Award for journalistic excellence and distinction goes to  John Schwada, a political-government and investigative reporter for KTTV Fox 11 News in Los Angeles. He has won two LA area Emmy awards and a Golden Mike for three separate investigative reports. He is also a frequent contributor to blogs on the station’s website.

“From newspapers to TV reporting to blogging,” said Will Lewis, LA Press Club president, “ he has quickly adapted to new platforms while excelling in the coverage of local politics.”


Prior to joining KTTV in 1996, Schwada worked as a political and City Hall reporter for the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. In the 1980s he won LA Press Club awards for his series investigating Councilman Richard Alatorre’s illegal use of campaign money in his 1985 council race and for his investigation of Mayor Tom Bradley’s questionable ties to Far East National Bank. After the Herald-Examiner folded in Nov. 1989, Schwada was immediately hired by the Los Angeles Times where he helped develop a weekly political column for the paper’s Valley edition, covered politics and City Hall.
