Free Screening of Award-Winning Documentary
-----------------------------------------------

“A Bitter Taste of Freedom” a film by Marina Goldovskaya.

It is a documentary about slain Russian reporter Anna Politkovskaya. While it is a personal and touching portrayal of Anna Politovskaya as a troubled wife and loving mother, it also shows the lengths that she, as a journalist, would go in the search for truth. She was investigating breach of human rights in Chetznya. This documentary was co-winner of the Montreal Festival.

Variety:  “Profoundly moving, politically provocative and apt to provoke moral outrage in anyone short of Vladimir Putin.”  Following the free screening, Ms. Goldovskaya will address the audience in a Q & A.

The Los Angeles Press Club posthumously awarded Ms. Politkovskaya the Daniel Pearl Award for Courage and Integrity in Journalism in 2007.
