-----------------------------------------------

Bob Woodward watched and participated  through a Skype video hookup that allowed the audience to watch and hear him while he watched the award ceremony back east. Woodward couldn’t make the trip because he was on deadline for his next book that’s about Obama.

Bernstein talked about how Nixon had wanted to get at Daniel Ellsberg who had leaked the Pentagon Papers to the NY Times and the Washington Post. Nixon referred to Ellsberg as one of those “arrogant Jews.”   But as Bernstein found out by talking to Ellsberg’s granddaughter who was seated at his table, Ellsberg was not Jewish. He was a Christian Scientist. “My Watergate reporting continues,” he quipped.
