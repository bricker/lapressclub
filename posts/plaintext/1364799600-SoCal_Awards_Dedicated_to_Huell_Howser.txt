SoCal Awards Dedicated to Huell Howser
-----------------------------------------------

The Southern California Journalism Awards Centennial Gala on June 23, 2013 is being dedicated to Huell Howser, the widely loved KCET personality and unofficial ambassador of California, who died in January in Palm Springs at age 67.
