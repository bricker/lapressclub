Your LA Press Club is teaming up with BiddingFor Good, the nation’s leading online auction fundraising service. This creates a unique marketing and advertising opportunity for donors to promote products and services and acquire affluent customers while supporting award-winning journalism in Southern California.

Our online auction opens June 12– two weeks before our live auction on June 27 at our 52nd Awards Gala in the Crystal Ballroom at the Biltmore.

But the sooner we receive your committment, your product or service and your company will be listed on our website, Facebook and Twitter and other social networks–and on our auction page @BiddingForGood.com. Our online auction can expose your item to many of some 150,000 registered charity bidders in the nation, as well as many here in the Southland.
